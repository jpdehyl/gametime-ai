# GameTime.ai — Website Redesign Plan

## Brand
- **Product:** GameTime.ai
- **Parent:** GroundGame (Marc Snegg, CEO)
- **Created by:** JP (CTO/Technical Co-founder)
- **Style:** Mondrian colors (red #FF0000, yellow #FFDE00, blue #0000FF, black, white) + Factory.ai-level cleanliness & spacing
- **Tone:** Confident, minimal, technical but accessible. Not salesy.

## Positioning
"The AI layer that makes your workforce amazingly productive."

## Design Principles (Mondrian meets Factory)
- Mondrian colors as ACCENTS, not full blocks everywhere
- Lots of white/dark space
- Bold geometric elements but restrained
- Typography: heavy headlines, clean body
- No fake stats, no fake testimonials
- Real product screenshots when available
- Grid lines as design elements, not overwhelming
